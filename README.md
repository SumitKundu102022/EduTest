## üåü About The Project

**EduTest** is an innovative, full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application designed to transform the online assessment and learning experience. It offers a comprehensive platform where educators and administrators can effortlessly create and manage tests, while candidates can engage in personalized assessments, track their progress, and enhance their knowledge.

A core distinguishing feature of EduTest is its **integrated AI capabilities for dynamic content generation**. This allows administrators to generate diverse and relevant test questions directly from their notes or provided content, significantly streamlining the test creation process and ensuring high-quality assessments.

The application prioritizes a seamless and secure user experience, featuring flexible authentication options, a highly responsive design, and intuitive navigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [MongoDB Atlas Account](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) (for cloud database)
* [Google Cloud Console Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (for Google OAuth Client ID)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SumitKundu102022/EduTest](https://github.com/SumitKundu102022/EduTest) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd edutest-app/edutest_backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create `.env` file:**
    In the `edutest_backend` directory, create a file named `.env` and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string 
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_random_secret_key_for_jwt
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_web_client_id_from_google_cloud_console
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Or your frontend's local dev URL
    ```
    * **`MONGO_URI`**: Get this from your MongoDB Atlas cluster. Remember to replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>`.
    * **`JWT_SECRET`**: Generate a long, random string. You can use `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` in your terminal.
    * **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`**: Obtain this from your Google Cloud Console (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs, Web application type). Ensure `http://localhost:5173` (or your frontend's local URL) is listed in "Authorized JavaScript origins" and "Authorized redirect URIs".
4.  **Run the backend:**
    ```bash
    npm run server # Or 'npm start' if you prefer
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../edutest_frontend # Assuming it's in a sibling directory
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create `.env.local` file:**
    In the `edutest_frontend` directory, create a file named `.env.local` and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_web_client_id_from_google_cloud_console
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Points to your local backend
    ```
    * **`VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`**: This must be the *same* client ID as used in your backend's `.env` file.
4.  **Run the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically start on `http://localhost:5173`.

## üåê Deployment

EduTest is designed for easy deployment to cloud platforms. The recommended platform is [Render.com](https://render.com/).

### Backend Deployment (Render)

1.  Push your `edutest_backend` folder to a Git repository.
2.  Create a new Web Service on Render.
3.  Point Render to your backend repository and set the `Root Directory` to `edutest_backend` if it's not the repo root.
4.  Configure `Build Command` as `npm install` and `Start Command` as `npm start`.
5.  **Crucially, add all your backend environment variables** (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `FRONTEND_URL`) directly in Render's environment settings for the service.
    * For `FRONTEND_URL`, use the deployed URL of your frontend (e.g., `https://your-frontend-app.onrender.com`).

### Frontend Deployment (Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

1.  Push your `edutest_frontend` folder to a Git repository.
2.  Create a new Static Site or Web Service on your chosen platform.
3.  Point the platform to your frontend repository and set the `Root Directory` to `edutest_frontend` if necessary.
4.  **Add your frontend environment variables** (`VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`) in the platform's environment settings.
    * For `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, use the deployed URL of your backend (e.g., `https://your-backend-api.onrender.com/api`).
5.  **Update Google Cloud Console:** After deploying your frontend, remember to add its deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-frontend-app.onrender.com`) to the "Authorized JavaScript origins" and "Authorized redirect URIs" in your Google Cloud Console OAuth client ID settings.
